# Arduino-LED-RGB
# Contextualization
In this experiment, you will make an RGB LED controlled by digital pins 11, 10, and 9 (PWM) intermittently light up. The RGB LED has 3 LEDs inside, where pin 11 controls the red LED, pin 10 controls the blue LED, and pin 9 controls the green LED. The brightness of each LED is controlled by assigning a value between 0 and 255.
